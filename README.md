# Code for Task 1:
>- [Submersible_motion_model.py](https://github.com/Higasa-Yumetaka/MCM_Control_Number_2428217_Python/blob/master/Submersible_motion_model.py)\
> Used for dynamic simulation of a submersible in Task 1, running this file separately will simulate the descent path of a submersible.

# Code for Task 2:
>- [MatLab_Codes/task2.m](https://github.com/Higasa-Yumetaka/MCM_Control_Number_2428217_Python/blob/master/MatLab_Codes/task2.m)\
> We have considered several devices for underwater search and assigned attributes with corresponding scores to each of them. Using AHP, we determined the relationships between these attributes and calculated the cost-efficiency ratio for each device as a score. Subsequently, we selected the top-scoring devices to be mounted on the host ship.
>- [AHP2.py](https://github.com/Higasa-Yumetaka/MCM_Control_Number_2428217_Python/blob/master/AHP2.py)
>> Analytic Hierarchy Process:By inputting the matrix of importance relationships, we calculated the importance coefficients between various attributes, which serve as the factors for scoring.

# Code for Task 3:
>- [MatLab_Codes/task3.m](https://github.com/Higasa-Yumetaka/MCM_Control_Number_2428217_Python/blob/master/MatLab_Codes/task3.m)\
